I obtained this src back in 2014 or early 2015 from ph0ne,because I told 
him I wanted to try and understand the mechanics of a hack and possibly
learn from it ,but me and him had a falling out soon after he gave me this
and decided it has been long enough and post it in hopes someone will be 
kind enuff to share their solution.
